# Line Count

A service for calculating line counts of GitHub-hosted projects.

Built with node.js + Socket.IO.

# Demo

Will be running here until my Engine Yard free trail runs out!

# Notes

The actual line-counting code is very shoddy, so it will count some comment lines as lines of code. Also anything other than a small and arbitrary list of languages is just listed as 'Text'.
